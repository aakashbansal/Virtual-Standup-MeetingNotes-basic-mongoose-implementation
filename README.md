# Virtual-Standup-MeetingNotes-basic-mongoose-implementation

Virtual-Standup-MeetingNotes is a pretty basic web app built in Node.js that employs Mongoose as an ORM for database. The app was built for learning purposes for getting familiar with Node.js and MongoDB/Mongoose and has a very basic implementation.

The users can post new **Meeting Notes** and can also view the earlier notes. The notes can also be filtered by a particular user.

## Project Setup

The following project requires **Node.Js** and **NPM** to be pre-installed and the necessary path variables for **Node** and **NPM** should also be set-up already.

Open the terminal/command-line :

```
$ cd \<required-directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/aakashbansal/Virtual-Standup-MeetingNotes-basic-mongoose-implementation.git
$ cd \Virtual-Standup-MeetingNotes-basic-mongoose-implementation
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This starts the Node server. Now open the web browser and go to **http://localhost:3000/** to view the app.
